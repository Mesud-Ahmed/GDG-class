# Week 3 Mini Project

This mini project includes two functional React components: `UseCard` and `Counter`. These components are designed to practice core React concepts such as props, state, and conditional rendering.

---

## UseCard Component

The `UseCard` component displays user information such as name, age, and email in a styled card format.

### Features
- Displays user details in a structured list.
- Accepts a dynamic background color using the `bgColor` prop for customization.

## Counter Component

The `Counter` component provides interactive counter functionality with the ability to increment, decrement, and reset the count.

### Features
- **Increment**: Increases the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter value by 1, but disables the button when the counter is at `0`.
- **Reset**: Resets the counter value to `0`.

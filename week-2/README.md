# Week 2 Class Assignment - React Component Rendering

This is a simple React project where we display a list of names dynamically using components.

## Project Overview
In this project:
- We have an `App` component that manages an array of names.
- The `App` component maps over the `names` array and passes each name to the `DisplayNames` component.
- The `DisplayNames` component receives the name as a prop and displays it in an `<h2>` tag.
